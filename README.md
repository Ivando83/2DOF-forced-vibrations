# 2DOF-forced-vibrations
Code for computing the forced vibration characteristics of a 2 degree of freedom mechanical system. The 2 DOF system is assumed to be a simple car model with its mass concentrated in a rectangular mass which can translate vertically (bounce) and rotate about its central axis normal to the plane (pitch). The front and rear suspension of the car is modelled using a spring and damper system connected to the rectangle at a particular distance from the centre of mass. There is some form of excitation on the system, in this project, that is either through an external harmonic force (frequency independent) acting at a particular eccentricty from the centre of mass or via road bumps (modelled as fixed amplitude waves having contant wavelengths). The governing equation of motion for this tye of system is a coupled (or non-coupled depending on the system parameters) non-homogeneous (or the pitch equation can be homogeneous if the external force has no eccentricity) ordinary differential equation. 3 approaches have been taken in the code to solve for the system: 1). Analytical approach where the code is built according to the same exact steps which are taken while analytically solving the equation of motion (generating the characteristic polynomial and then calculating the eigen values from the polynomial). This approach has the fastest computing time, but is extremely time consuming and complex to code. 

2). Numerical approach where the equation of motion is represented in the state space vector form (derivative of state_matrix = system_matrix*(state_matrix) + excitation_matrix) and the ode45 solver in MATLAB is used with the objective function whose independent variables are the time vector and the state vector while the dependent vector is the first derivate of the state vector. This approach is a little slower than the analytical approach but can be used with ease in systems having complex modelling depths. 

3). Symbolic approach where the equations of motion (2nd order non-homogeneous ODE) is solved symbollically. This approach is too slow to be worhty of use here.

Local and global optimization algorithms have also been applied to calculate the optimum amount of damping for minimal excitations. For a range of applied harmonic force frequencies, the aggregate amplitude of the system (programmed as a seperate 'cost' function) is calculated (thus representing a kind of a frequency response function) which will provide local/global maximas of the cost function (aggregate amplitude) for the natural frequencies of the system.
